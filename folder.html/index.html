                    Hello, I am Kaylana Christerfield. I am a  student in 10th grade at southeastern Highschool. 
                    For the last month, I’ve been learning HTML and CSS with Journi. 
                     During the month I  had made 5 finish projects. This is my second time with this program. 
                    Learning with journi has helped me prepare for my main goal which is to be a game developer.

            <h2> Dream Job</h2>
          
            <p class="col-md-9">
                Being able to become a game developer would be a dream come true. 
                One of the main reasons I want to get into the game industry is so I can add more POC queer representatives to the media. 
                It would be amazing to see queer characters besides white gay males. The second main reason is that I see myself as a creative person; 
                I wanted to draw when I was younger but I never was able to get good at it. 
                Then I learned more about coding and game development which helped me realize I can still bring my stories to life.			
            </p>

            <h2> Future Plans </h2>

            <p>
                In 2 years I  see myself as a Junior in high school working on progressing my knowledge of code.
                In 5 years I see myself making my first game; I’m not sure if it will be advance though I am confident that over that it would be functional. 
                I will continue my learning through self-teaching programs. There are many programs like khan-academy and code-academy that I can use to further my education. 
                It seems like the hardest part will be finding an artist to work with me.
